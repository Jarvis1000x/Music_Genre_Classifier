# Music Genre Classifier
This repository is a group of neural network architectures for Classifing Music Genres using Convolutional Neural Networks &amp; Recurrent Neural Networks. The model takes raw audio as input and extracts MFCCs, which is used for classification

## Dataset

All the models were trained on the  [GTZAN Dataset for Music Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).
